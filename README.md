# SQLite extensions incubator

The incubator contains SQLite extensions which haven't yet made their way to the main extension set. They may be untested, poorly documented, and without a well-thought API.

See the [full extension list](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/issues/27) and vote for your favorites! We'll merge the most popular ones into the main extension set.

Meanwhile, you can download compiled incubator extensions as they are and use them if you like.

## Download

There are [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/releases/tag/incubator) for every OS:

-   `*.dll` - for Windows
-   `*.so` - for Linux
-   `*.dylib` - for macOS

Binaries are 64-bit and require a 64-bit SQLite version. If you are using SQLite shell on Windows (`sqlite.exe`), its 64-bit version is available at https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlite.

## Usage

CLI usage:

```
sqlite> .load ./cbrt
sqlite> select cbrt(27);
3.0
```

IDE usage:

```
select load_extension('/path/to/extension/cbrt');
select cbrt(27);
```

In-app usage:

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
connection.enable_load_extension(True)
connection.load_extension("./cbrt.so")
connection.execute("select cbrt(27)")
connection.close()
```

You can specify any other supported extension instead of `cbrt`.
