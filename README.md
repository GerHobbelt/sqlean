# SQLite extensions incubator

The incubator contains SQLite extensions which haven't yet made their way to the main set. They may be untested, poorly documented, too broad, too narrow, or without a well-thought API. Think of them as candidates for the standard library.

See the [full extension list](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/issues/27) and vote for your favorites! We'll refactor and merge popular ones into the main set.

Meanwhile, you can download compiled incubator extensions as they are and use them if you like.

## Download

There are [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/releases/tag/incubator) for every OS:

-   `*.dll` - for Windows
-   `*.so` - for Linux
-   `*.dylib` - for macOS

Binaries are 64-bit and require a 64-bit SQLite version. If you are using SQLite shell on Windows (`sqlite.exe`), its 64-bit version is available at https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlite.

## Usage

CLI usage:

```
sqlite> .load ./cbrt
sqlite> select cbrt(27);
3.0
```

IDE usage:

```
select load_extension('/path/to/extension/cbrt');
select cbrt(27);
```

In-app usage:

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
connection.enable_load_extension(True)
connection.load_extension("./cbrt.so")
connection.execute("select cbrt(27)")
connection.close()
```

You can specify any other supported extension instead of `cbrt`.
